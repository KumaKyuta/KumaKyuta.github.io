        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p>I'm Dwayne. I began taking interest in design from an early age. Initially I was just interested in construction and Architecture, but that interest shifted into 3D Modeling and programming. Now, I'm focused on taking my first steps to become a developer and to increase my skills in both design and programming.</p>
